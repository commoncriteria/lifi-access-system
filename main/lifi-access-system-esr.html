		This document describes a core set of high-level fundamental security requirements expected of any Light Fidelity (LiFi) Access System (AS) in terms of [CC] for use in Wireless networks. It is intended to provide asset of requirements which can be built upon by future revisions to provide an overall set of security solutions for a Wireless network.
	<div class="section" id="usecases">Use Cases</div>
	  The TOE is a distributed system consisting of multiple network devices that collectively serve as the LiFi network endpoint. In addition to claiming the relevant "Distributed TOE" requirements in the NDcPP, this use case also requires the TOE to claim the optional Security Functional Requirement (SFR) FCS_CKM.2/DISTRIB to describe the key distribution method between distributed TOE components..

    	  <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">

		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> The following assumption are made about attackers' ability to develop attacks: </p>
			<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
				<li>
					T.NETWORK_DISCLOSURE: Devices on a protected network may be exposed to threats presented by devices located outside the protected network, which may attempt to conduct unauthorized activities. If malicious external devices are able to communicate with devices on the protected network, or if devices on the protected network can establish communications with those external devices (e.g., as a result of nonexistent or insufficient WLAN data encryption that exposes the WLAN data in transit to rogue elements), then those internal devices may be susceptible to the unauthorized disclosure of information.
				</li>
				<li>
					T.NETWORK_ACESS: Devices located outside the protected network may seek to exercise services located on the protected network that are intended to be only accessed from inside the protected network or only accessed by entities using an authenticated pat into the protected network.
				</li>
				<li>
					T.TSF_FAILURE: Security mechanisms of the TOE generally build up from a primitive set of mechanisms (e.g., memory management, privileged modes of process execution) to more complex sets of mechanisms. Failure of the primitive mechanisms could lead to a compromise in more complex mechanisms, resulting in a compromise of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF).
				</li>
				<li>
					T.DATA_INTEGRITY: Devices on a protected network may be exposed to threats presented by devices located outside the protected network, which may attempt to modify the data without authorization. If known malicious external devices are able to communicate with devices on the protected network or if devices on the protected network can establish communications with those external devices then the data contained within the communications may be susceptible to a loss of integrity.
				</li>
				<li>
					T.REPLAY_ATTACK: If an unauthorized individual successfully gains access to the system, the adversary may have the opportunity to conduct a "replay" attack. This method of attack allows the individual to capture packets trans versing throughout the wireless network and send the packets later, possibly unknown by the intended receiver.

	<div class="section" id="assumptions">Assumptions</div>
	  Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and 
	  its intended environment that can be assumed to hold true. This 
	  will provide additional scope on the resulting PP.

	  The following assumptions are made for the operating system product and its operational
	  environment: <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>The underlying platform is physically protected, to a large extent. The hardware
				that the product manages is secured by defensive measures that make physical attacks
				impractical for most attackers. At the same time, casual passersby might attempt to
				trivially access the system. </li>
			<li>The product implements some security-relevant functionality that does not require
				evaluation (e.g., network time synchronization, process scheduling, and virtual
				memory management including process separation). </li>
			<li>Depending on configuration and capability, the product may or may not be: <ul>
					<li>configuration-managed by the enterprise</li>
					<li>bound to directory services to support multi-user login</li> </ul>
			</li>
			<li> The product runs application software developed by a third-party. The applications are
				not intentionally developed to be malicious, but can contain inadvertent coding
				errors. These errors introduce risk that control of an application may be seized by
				a malicious entity. The product shall confine these applications within the originally
				designated operating environment. </li>
			<li>The platform is connected to a network. For purposes of sending/receiving data, to
				include software updates, the platform is connected to other entities. Other
				entities on the network are not inherently trustable. </li>
			<li>Administrators are not malicious in nature.</li>
			<li> Users are not malicious in nature, though they may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behavior. </li>
		</ul>
	<div class="section" id="extensions">Optional Extensions</div>
		Additional security functionality that may
		be appropriate for some use cases, and can be expressed in extensions to this document,
		includes:
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>
				The TSF shall distribute the IEEE 802.11 keys in accordance with a specified key distribution method: [trusted channel protocol specified in FPT_)ITT.1 (Base-PP) ] that meets the following: [standards specified in the various iterations of FCS_COP.1] and does not expose the cryptographic keys.

	<div class="section" id="outsidescope">Outside the TOE's Scope</div>
	  <!--
			This is where the authors explicitly state things they do not want 
			to be considered for inclusion in an evaluation against a 
			resulting PP.  Items expressed here could include threats, 
			functions or capabilities that would require assurance activities 
			that are too subjective, or specific expertise not available in the
			evaluation facilities expected to assess products against the PP 
	  -->
		The following list contains items that are explicitly out-of-scope for any evaluation
		against the product PP <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>Malicious, Highly-Privileged Administrators - Highly-privileged administrators
				acting maliciously can disable most, if not all, security protections on the product.
				Additionally procedural controls that are out of scope of this document should be
				considered to help highlight administrator accounts acting suspiciously.</li>
			<li>Zero Days - The disclosure of recently published vulnerabilities (Zero Days) should
				not be used as a reason to fail an product undergoing evaluation.</li>
			<li>Unofficial Versions - Non-vendor supplied install images often contain added
				functionality and may weaken the normal operating functionality of the product</li>
			<li>Platform - The product PP shall not address the hardware or firmware of its underlying
				platform to include the boot sequence before control is handed off to the product. That
				the platform itself is virtual or physical is irrelevant to any evaluations. It does address the configuration and handling of LiFI data to include drivers and services that support this feature within the firmware. Additionally the management services that support configuration of the TSF </li>
			<li>Applications - The product PP shall not address applications that are not delivered as
				part of the product installation process. </li>
